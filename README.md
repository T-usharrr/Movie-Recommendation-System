# Movie-Recommendation-System

## Description:

This project tackles the age-old dilemma: "What movie should I watch?" I built a user-friendly website that leverages movie data to suggest similar films based on your preferences. Here's how it works:

1. Simple Selection: Browse through a comprehensive list of movies and choose the one that piques your interest.
2. Personalized Recommendations: Click the "Recommendation" button, and the website utilizes machine learning algorithms to curate a personalized list of 10 similar movies.
3. Visual Inspiration: Each recommended movie is displayed with its title and poster image, making it easy to discover your next cinematic adventure.
## 1. First, this is the Overview of the Website

## 2. Click on the Select bar to Select any Movie that you want to see a similar type of it.
